Support for cloud synchronization or backups will never be added due to the inherent security issues. Rather a device-to-device import/export feature is planned. Support for autofill is not implemented due to the complexity and current lack of documentation associated. Users of the application is encouraged to take part in development and even build the source code by themselves, as this provides maximum security. The application is available free of charge through our GitHub releases but not from the Google Play Store - we charge for the distribution there."
