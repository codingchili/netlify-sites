      - name: credential cloud synchronization
        supported:
          - times
    content: The Enigmatic Mouse attempts to be a modern and minimalistic password
      manager. Support for cloud synchronization or backups will never be added due
      to the inherent security issues. Rather a device-to-device import/export feature
      is planned. Support for autofill is not implemented due to the complexity and
      current lack of documentation associated. Users of the application is encouraged
      to take part in development and even build the source code by themselves, as
      this provides maximum security. The application is available free of charge
      through our GitHub releases but not from the Google Play Store - we charge for
      the distribution there.
