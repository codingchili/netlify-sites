    description:
      Software developer and security enthusiast with an interest in networks.
      Working on open source projects with friendly licensing in my spare time, listed
      here are some of the more useful projects. Some of which build on my own frameworks,
      such as the backend framework 'chili-core' or 'static-mina' which is a static
      site generator. I love to work with new technology and awesome libraries.

      Prefer reactive microservices, Docker and NoSQL, disinterested in application servers and
      object relational mappers :)
